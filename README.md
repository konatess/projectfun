Build your very own game rules for 'rock paper scissors' - and share it with friends!  Introducing the world's first dynamic online rock-paper-scissors building tool that allows you to pick your own items to play in a game against friends. 

# Features Include:
* Select a name and image for each item in your game
* Family-friendly: curse words are NOT allowed
* Full visualization (for both mobile and web) 
* No heavy math required! The game will automatically plot out all the relationships needed; you simply provide the items
* Email authentication to publish/edit your game

# How It Works (The Math)
* To make a working game in the style of rock-paper-scissors, we know a few things that must always be true. You must have an odd number of items (to avoid ties), and each item must either beat -- or be defeated by -- every other item in the game.
* Mathematically speaking, this is represented as: for every (2n-1) items, there are (n-1) sets of relationships between items.
* We do the math for the user so that they don't have to think about how to draw these relationships 

# Future Features Include:
* Pick the 'directionality' for each step of your graph - draw the relationships 'clockwise' or 'counterclockwise' through the graph!
* Password reset
* Load and edit an already published game
* Save-as-you-go 
* OFfline caching
* More robust mobile version
* Select a game to play with a friend
* Play the selected ruleset with your friend online!
